# Vergessen? Nicht!

A simple [SuperMemo-2](https://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm) mimicking
flashcard program. Like [Anki](http://ankisrs.net) but much simpler and with
one million fewer features.

Build it the usual Go way, and run it with a deck filename. Add cards, study
cards, edit and delete 'em!
